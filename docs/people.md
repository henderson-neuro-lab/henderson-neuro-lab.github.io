### Principal Investigator: Maggie Henderson

I am an incoming Assistant Professor (starting September 2024) in the [Psychology Department](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/henderson-margaret.html) at CMU, with a courtesy appointment in the [Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/). Prior to this, I was a postdoc at CMU, working with Leila Wehbe and Michael Tarr. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Biological Sciences from Cornell University, then obtained my Ph.D. in Neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego, where I worked with John Serences.

See my full CV [here](files/CV_MH_2024.pdf).
