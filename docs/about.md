Our lab aims to understand the neural and computational basis of human visual cognition. How do we extract meaningful, high-level information from noisy visual inputs? How does this process take into account the statistical structure of the world we live in? 
How does visual processing adapt to changes in our goals and internal state? 

To address these questions, we leverage experimental techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral studies performed with healthy human participants. We also use advanced computational approaches, including modeling applied to fMRI and behavioral data as well as in-silico experiments in artificial neural network models.
