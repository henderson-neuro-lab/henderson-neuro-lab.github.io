Our research focuses on human visual perception. We aim to understand how our visual perception reflects the structure of the world we live in as well as our need for adaptive everyday behavior. How do we compute meaningful, high-level information from noisy visual inputs, taking into account our experience with the statistics of our environment? How do we adapt these representations to changes in our goals and internal state? 

To address these questions, our research leverages experimental techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral studies performed with healthy human participants. We also use advanced computational approaches, including modeling applied to fMRI and behavioral data as well as in-silico experiments in artificial neural network models.

Here are a few areas of current interest:

### Cortical representations of intermediate-level visual features

Visual cortex performs hierarchical computations that bridge from simple features like edges and colors to complex features like object and scene parts. What are the representations that lie between these levels of complexity, and how can we understand such intermediate features from a computational perspective? We're aiming to understand <b>how intermediate features are computed in the brain and how they contribute to behavior.</b> Another goal is to determine how our visual processing is constrained by the statistical distribution of intermediate features in the environment.

### Flexible processing in higher visual cortex

To support adaptive behavior, visual cortex circuits must integrate information about the behavioral goals of an observer, adjusting representations according to task-relevance. Not much is known about how the mechanisms of <b>flexible neural coding during naturalistic, high-level visual tasks.</b> How do we selectively attend to a specific category of objects within in a cluttered scene? How do we adaptively make decisions about objects when category boundaries change? We're aiming to understand how such tasks are supported by neural codes in higher visual cortex.
