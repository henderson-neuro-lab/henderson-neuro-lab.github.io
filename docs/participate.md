We are recruiting new participants for behavioral and fMRI (brain imaging) studies. Studies take place either in Baker Hall or at the CMU-Pitt BRIDGE center, and may include one or multiple sessions. Participants will be compensated monetarily or with course credit. To participate, you must be 18 years of age or older and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
