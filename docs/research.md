Here are a few topics the lab is pursuing currently:

### Cortical representations of intermediate-level visual features

Visual cortex performs hierarchical computations that bridge from simple features like edges and colors to complex features like object and scene parts. What are the representations that lie between these levels of complexity, and how can we understand these intermediate features from a computational perspective? We're aiming to understand <b>how intermediate features are computed in the brain and how they contribute to behavior.</b> Another goal is to determine how our intermediate visual processing is ultimately constrained by the statistical distribution of features in the environment.

### Natural image statistics & category learning

Our visual environment is highly structured in its feature statistics, with certain features being encountered more often than others. Morevoer, the statistics of our visual inputs may evolve over time during development, due to changes in visual sensitivity as well as visuomotor behavior. How do these properties of the <b>environment provide a curriculum that enables efficient category learning?</b> How is the structure of visual representations constrained by the structure of visual inputs? We're working to address these questions using simulated learning experiments performed in deep neural network models.

### Flexible processing in higher visual cortex

To support behavioral goals, visual cortex circuits may adaptively adjust stimulus representations according to task-relevance. This idea of flexible neural coding has often been studied in the context of simple laboratory tasks, leading to many open questions about how <b>flexible neural codes might contribute to more naturalistic, high-level visual tasks.</b> How do we selectively attend to a specific category of objects within in a cluttered natural scene? How is the "object space" represented in higher visual cortex warped by changes in behavioral priority? We're addressing these questions using behavior and fMRI studies.
